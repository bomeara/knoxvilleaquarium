title: "About"
---

This was created on a Saturday morning by Brian O'Meara, a natural history enthusiast living in Oak Ridge, TN, but NOT by any means an architect or philanthropist, while sitting in a hammock in his backyard. It reflects a quick inspirational idea for an unused site, not a full project proposal. I freely release this idea into the world -- anyone should feel free to run with it and modify it as they see fit, with no permission required from me!

Note that nothing written here implies any endorsement by any current, past, or future employers, other colleagues, philanthropies, government officials, etc. I just like looking at fish and helping people learn about the natural world.
