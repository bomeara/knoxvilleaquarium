    "text": "A common approach to aquariums is doing greatest hits: fish of the Amazon, coral reefs, sharks, etc., plus a tank or two of local fish. That would be possible here, but it’s such an amazing place that one could focus it on just this region. Another twist could be adding a paleo-aquarium component: closest relatives of the animals that USED to be here in the past, back when a sea covered this region (we can still find marine fossils in Tennessee). Some potential ideas:"

Let’s recreate that ocean by showing the closest relatives to the organisms that used to live in it. They are not a perfect match since they have changed (the closest living relative to a T. rex is any modern bird, but a chicken coop makes for a bad “Return to the Cretaceous” exhibit), but there are often living examples that are similar. For example, crinoid fossils are abundant, and there are living crinoids, but they are very rarely exhibited in aquariums (they are hard to maintain)."

    "text": "This was created on a Saturday morning (Aug 16, 2025) by Brian O’Meara, a natural history enthusiast living in Oak Ridge, TN, but NOT by any means an architect or philanthropist, while sitting in a hammock in his backyard. It reflects a quick inspirational idea for an unused site, not a full project proposal. I freely release this idea into the world – anyone should feel free to run with it and modify it as they see fit, with no permission required from me! I’m not volunteering to lead an initiative for this – I’m overcommitted to many things as is, so someone else would need to lead this if you want to see it come to fruition. If you want to reach out to me, omeara.brian@gmail.com. Also, if this does become a real thing, I’ll happily (and without cost) transfer over the domain name if it’d help you.\nNote that nothing written here implies any endorsement by any current, past, or future employers, other colleagues, philanthropies, government officials, etc. I just like looking at fish and helping people learn about the natural world, so when I saw that the proposed science museum site was now fallow, I thought, “you know what’d be neat?” and made this site."

    "text": "Aquariums are just fun places. But what could be some of the utility of one in Knoxville? Some of this is adapted from the advocacy for a science museum in Knoxville, but there are additional benefits as well.\n\nLonger stays in Knoxville: A small regional aquarium, no matter how lovely, probably will not draw tourists from far away on its own. But it makes people more likely to spend more time in Knoxville. Coming for a Vols football game? Book an extra night and check out the Knoxville Aquarium and the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame, maybe take a dinner cruise. Making Knoxville a weekend destination not just an event destination captures a lot more tourist dollars. The proximity of the new aquarium to the Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum will help with that, too.\nMore event space: A source of revenue for aquariums is renting out space for events. For conventions especially, having a place near a convention site (so no need to arrange transportation) but with a different feel can be great for receptions or mixers: an aquarium is a perfect place for this; see example pages from the New England Aquarium in Boston, the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, or the Florida Aquarium in Tampa. We can attract more conventions to Knoxville with an aquarium. It would also be great for weddings.\nActivate this part of Knoxville: More foot traffic, especially during the day.\nEducation: Easy accessibility from I-40 and I-75 means schools from all over the region can get to the aquarium easily. And a focus on Tennnessee fauna could lead to alignment with Tennessee state science standards.\nConservation: The Knoxville Aquarium would be located a block from the Tennessee River, which is cleaner than it has been in decades and is continuing to improve. Visitors could learn about the truly astounding variety of life in the river and its tributaries and ongoing efforts to restore it.\n\nOne would want to do a proper economic analysis of potential impact. Here are some comparisons:\n\nFlorida Aquarium: 407 jobs supported, $53.6 economic impact, in 2023\nNorwalk Aquarium: 620 jobs, $89M in economic impact, in 2022"

    "text": "There are at least three other nearby public aquariums:\n\nRipley’s Aquarium of the Smokies: This is about an hour away in Gatlinburg: within a feasible bus trip for students in the Knoxville and surrounding areas. It has some stunning exhibits.\nTennessee Aquarium: A spectacular aquarium in Chattanooga, about 1.75 hours away from the proposed Knoxville Aquarium site. It has two main buildings, one primarily for freshwater (River Journey) and one primarily saltwater (Ocean Journey), as well as an IMAX theater. It also has a robust conservation arm. One could imagine the proposed Knoxville Aquarium being a branch or affiliate of the Tennessee Aquarium (this idea has not been discussed at all with the Tennessee Aquarium, it’s just a thought).\nGeorgia Aquarium: Located in Atlanta (over three hours away), it is perhaps best known for its whale sharks.\n\nHowever, these are not the only “fishy” things around here.\n\nConservation Fisheries: A nonprofit that for over three decades has been raising endangered and other at-risk fish, including many of the amazing rare fish of Tennessee.\nSturgeon Reintroduction: groups within the Tennesseee Wildlife and Fisheries Agency, Tennessee Valley Authority, US Fish & Wildlife Service, the University of Tennessee, the Tennessee Aquarium, and others have been working to re-introduce and monitor these massive, long-lived, oddly-shaped fish for decades.\nEtnier Ichthyological Collection: It holds nearly half a million fish specimens from all around the planet. It can be used for everything from looking at rates of spread of invasive species to helping to determine whether a group of fish are one species or two to understanding changes in pollution over time.\nFish Research: This area of the world is home to a huge amount of fish biodiversity: the many streams and rivers passing down ancient mountains has led to a radiation of many different forms. We also have many caves with their own associated fauna. Some current fish projects at UTIA are here and some news release from the UTK Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are here.\niNaturalist: A community science project useful for people to identify what’s around them and for scientists to learn about locations of species. See here for ray-finned fish identified in the Knoxville region, for example.\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park: It’s just up the road for people from Knoxville, but it’s one of the world’s premier natural history locations. Here is information on the fish in the park, for example."

    "text": "Render of a Knoxville Aquarium\n\n\nIn April 2018, plans for a new science museum in Knoxville, Tennessee, were announced. It involved tearing down a law enforcement building and using the space for a science museum supported by a $150M private donation. Since then, the old building has been demolished and the site prepared, but as of Aug. 15, 2025, resources are instead going towards expansion of an existing popular science museum elsewhere in Knoxville. This leaves a site with a tremendous amount of potential: located close to downtown Knoxville, near various sports venues and other museums, having views of the Tennessee River and mountains, and with abundant parking. So what to do with this space?\nThis website presents a quick proposal: the Knoxville Aquarium. The website is just to popularize the idea: there is no organizational group fundraising for an aquarium, there are no discussions with city or county leadership, there are no hidden donors waiting to write checks (if you know any, though…).\nClick on the menu above for pages on the potential exhibits, site, utility of the project, comparisons to other places, and about the background of the proposer."
