See a map from the 2019 presentation made to the city of Knoxville by representatives of the Clayton Family Foundation and BarberMcMurry Architects (note that use of the map does not imply any endorsement by either of these groups of any plan for an aquarium at the site or any other ideas on this webpage).\n\n\n\nMap from presentation by representatives of the Clayton Family Foundation and BarberMcMurry Architects\n\n\nThere are three essentially adjacent parking garages. The area is used to handling sudden influxes of traffic given the proximity to the Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum, which hosts everything from Disney on Ice to ballet to concerts. It is close to interstates 40 and 75. See map below:\n\n\n\n\nCartoon GamesHeyGamesgoogle maps generator"

    "text": "Render of a Knoxville Aquarium\n\n\nIn April 2018, plans for a new science museum in Knoxville, Tennessee, were announced. It involved tearing down a law enforcement building and using the space for a science museum supported by a $150M private donation. Since then, the old building has been demolished and the site prepared, but resources are instead going towards expansion of an existing popular science museum elsewhere in Knoxville. This leaves a site with a tremendous amount of potential: located close to downtown Knoxville, near various sports venues and other museums, having views of the Tennessee River and mountains, and with abundant parking. So what to do with this space?\nThis website presents a quick proposal: the Knoxville Aquarium. The website is just to popularize the idea: there is no organizational group fundraising for an aquarium, there are no discussions with city or county leadership, there are no hidden donors waiting to write checks (if you know any, though…)."

    "text": "This was created on a Saturday morning by Brian O’Meara, an aquarium and natural history enthusiast living in Oak Ridge, TN, but NOT by any means an architect or philanthropist, while sitting in a hammock in his backyard. It reflects a quick inspirational idea for an unused site, not a full project proposal. I freely release this idea into the world – anyone should feel free to run with it and modify it as they see fit, with no permission required from me!"
