    "text": "A common approach to aquariums is doing greatest hits: fish of the Amazon, coral reefs, sharks, etc., plus a tank or two of local fish. That would be possible here, but it’s such an amazing place that one could focus it on just this region. Another twist could be adding a paleo-aquarium component: closest relatives of the animals that USED to be here in the past, back when a sea covered this region (we can still find marine fossils in Tennessee). Some potential ideas:"

    "text": "This was created on a Saturday morning by Brian O’Meara, a natural history enthusiast living in Oak Ridge, TN, but NOT by any means an architect or philanthropist, while sitting in a hammock in his backyard. It reflects a quick inspirational idea for an unused site, not a full project proposal. I freely release this idea into the world – anyone should feel free to run with it and modify it as they see fit, with no permission required from me!\nNote that nothing written here implies any endorsement by any current, past, or future employers, other colleagues, philanthropies, government officials, etc. I just like looking at fish and helping people learn about the natural world."

    "text": "There are at least three other nearby public aquariums:\n\nRipley’s Aquarium of the Smokies: This is about an hour away in Gatlinburg: within a feasible bus trip for students in the Knoxville and surrounding areas. It has some stunning exhibits.\nTennessee Aquarium: A spectacular aquarium in Chattanooga, about 1.75 hours away from the proposed Knoxville Aquarium site. It has two main buildings, one primarily for freshwater (River Journey) and one primarily saltwater (Ocean Journey), as well as an IMAX theater. It also has a robust conservation arm. One could imagine the proposed Knoxville Aquarium being a branch or affiliate of the Tennessee Aquarium (this idea has not been discussed at all with the Tennessee Aquarium, it’s just a thought).\nGeorgia Aquarium: Located in Atlanta (over three hours away), it is perhaps best known for its whale sharks.\n\nHowever, these are not the only “fishy” things around here.\n\nConservation Fisheries: A nonprofit that for over three decades has been raising endangered and other at-risk fish, including many of the amazing rare fish of Tennessee.\nSturgeon Reintroduction: groups within the Tennesseee Wildlife and Fisheries Agency, Tennessee Valley Authority, US Fish & Wildlife Service, the University of Tennessee, the Tennessee Aquarium, and others have been working to re-introduce and monitor these massive, long-lived, oddly-shaped fish for decades.\nEtnier Ichthyological Collection: It holds nearly half a million fish specimens from all around the planet. It can be used for everything from looking at rates of spread of invasive species to helping to determine whether a group of fish are one species or two to understanding changes in pollution over time.\n[Fish Research]: This area of the world is home to a huge amount of fish biodiversity: the many streams and rivers passing down ancient mountains has led to a radiation of many different forms. We also have many caves with their own associated fauna. Some current fish projects at UTIA are here and some news release from the UTK Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are here.\niNaturalist: A community science project useful for people to identify what’s around them and for scientists to learn about locations of species. See here for ray-finned fish identified in the Knoxville region, for example.\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park: It’s just up the road for people from Knoxville, but it’s one of the world’s premier natural history locations. Here is information on the fish in the park, for example."

    "text": "Render of a Knoxville Aquarium\n\n\nIn April 2018, plans for a new science museum in Knoxville, Tennessee, were announced. It involved tearing down a law enforcement building and using the space for a science museum supported by a $150M private donation. Since then, the old building has been demolished and the site prepared, but resources are instead going towards expansion of an existing popular science museum elsewhere in Knoxville. This leaves a site with a tremendous amount of potential: located close to downtown Knoxville, near various sports venues and other museums, having views of the Tennessee River and mountains, and with abundant parking. So what to do with this space?\nThis website presents a quick proposal: the Knoxville Aquarium. The website is just to popularize the idea: there is no organizational group fundraising for an aquarium, there are no discussions with city or county leadership, there are no hidden donors waiting to write checks (if you know any, though…)."

The area is used to handling sudden influxes of traffic given the proximity to the Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum, which hosts everything from Disney on Ice to ballet to concerts. It is close to interstates 40 and 75. See map below:\n\n\n\n\nCartoon GamesHeyGamesgoogle maps generator"
